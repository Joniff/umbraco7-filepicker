# File Picker

A File Picker property editor for Umbraco 7

After installing the package you can add a new datatype with the property editor 'File Picker'. You must select the folder from which a file can be selected. Optionally you can also supply a comma separated list of file extensions (i.e. 'png,jpg') to filter the files to choose from.

When the datatype is configured you can add it to your document types

Many, many thanks to Lee Kelleher and Matt Brailsford for turning my initial proof of concept into a real package.
